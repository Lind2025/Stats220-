# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am particularly interested in code, I have learned Stats380, so I think it will be easier to learn Stats220, and the most important thing is that I have a more comprehensive knowledge of code, so I will be more confident and interested in studying some interesting or complex problems.
- I am interested in learning about  how to use code to implement some really interesting applications, because my friend told me that this course is particularly interesting, can make some drawings, so I really want to learn this part.
