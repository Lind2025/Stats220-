# This is my first levels of headers
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## This is my second level of headers
*A little about me*:

 
<!--- numbered lists --->

1. I am undertaking a degree in **Bachelor of Science**.
2. I am taking STATS 220 because I am particularly interested in code, I have learned Stats380, so I think it will be easier to learn Stats220, and the most important thing is that I have a more comprehensive knowledge of code, so I will be more confident and interested in studying some interesting or complex problems.

<!--- unordered lists --->

- I am interested in learning about how to use code to implement some really interesting 
applications, because my friend told me that this course is particularly interesting, can make some drawings, so I really want to learn this part.
